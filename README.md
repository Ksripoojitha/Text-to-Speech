Pyttsx for python3 [ Offline text to speech for python3]

Pyttsx is a good text to speech conversion library in python but it was written only in python2 untill now ! Even some fair amount of googling didnâ€™t help much to get a tts library compatible with Python3.

How to install :

     pip install pyttsx3
     
Usage :

import pyttsx3

engine = pyttsx3.init()

engine.say("I will speak this text")

engine.runAndWait()
